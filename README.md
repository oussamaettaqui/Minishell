## About

Minishell is a simplified command-line interpreter designed to provide a foundational understanding of shell behavior. While shells might appear straightforward, their intricate logic and precise execution demand careful attention to detail.

## Challenge

Building Minishell was a significant undertaking, especially as my first group project. The aim was to replicate a subset of bash functionality, including:

* Core features:
  * Interactive prompt
  * Command history
  * Executable search and launching
  * Quote handling (single and double)
  * Redirections (input, output, append, heredoc)
  * Pipes
  * Environment variables
  * Exit status ($?)
  * Signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+)
* Built-in commands:
  * echo (with -n option)
  * cd (relative or absolute paths)
  * pwd (with no option)
  * export (with no option)
  * unset (with no option)
  * env (with no option)
  * exit (with no option)

By tackling this project, we gained invaluable experience in command parsing, process management, and shell intricacies.
